# Safe Charging in AOSP ROMs

#### If you are using Custom/GSI ROMs there is a high risk of reducing the battery health without smart charging of MIUI. Even some ROMs have built-in integration systems it would be better to have guaranteed working method. You might lose the highest possible charging speed. It is worth it. Better safe than regret.

## Features:
- **The lowest possible battery percentage** (to prevent offline charging issues by shutting down the device earlier with enough power left)
- **The cooldown feature by reducing charging speed** (to prevent uncontrolled charging)
- **Limited charging percentage** (to prevent overcharging when you left the device charging for whole night)
- **Fully customizable time/temperature limits** (to make it support more devices)
- **Detailed information about battery** (temperature, capacity, voltage, power, income/outcome, etc ...)
- **Comfortable UI experience rather than messy terminal codes**
